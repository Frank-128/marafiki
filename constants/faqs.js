        "children": <p className={"text-white"}>We implement strict quality control measures at every stage of the process. Our dedicated quality controllers conduct preloading and loading inspections, sampling every bag to ensure consistency and adherence to buyer specifications. We store these samples for three months to address any potential claims or quality concerns.</p>

        "label": "Is Pre-contracting possible before the coffee season?",
        "children": <p className={"text-white"}>Yes, pre-contracting is available before the coffee season begins. Most of our sellers prefer to contract at the start of the season, once they have a clear idea of how much coffee they will process. However, due to the volatility of coffee prices, many sellers opt to contract based on quantity and quality, leaving the final price open until closer to the actual sale. This flexibility allows both sellers and buyers to manage risks associated with price fluctuations."</p>

        key:"7",
        "label": "What are the terms of payment to most of your sellers?",
        "children": <p className={"text-white"}>85% of our sellers prefer FOT (Free on Truck) payment terms. This means that the coffee is delivered to the buyer’s designated carrier, and the seller covers all costs until the coffee is loaded onto the truck. After that, the buyer assumes responsibility. However, we ensure that the payment terms are always discussed and agreed upon, providing flexibility for both parties to come to a fair agreement.</p>
