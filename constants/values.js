Before any coffee bean is shipped, our expert quality controllers rigorously oversee the process. Pre-loading samples are randomly drawn from multiple points around the stack, ensuring a thorough and representative sampling. During the loading phase, we extract samples from 100% of the bags, eliminating any chance of sampling errors. Each sample undergoes comprehensive analysis to ensure it meets the specified quality. To further safeguard against discrepancies or claims, we retain these samples for three months, offering our buyers the assurance of full traceability. Upon request, we can seal the samples, underscoring our commitment to both transparency and excellence.",
